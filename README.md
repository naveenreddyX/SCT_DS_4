🚦 Traffic Accident Analysis – Data Science Project

📌 Project Title:

Analyzing Traffic Accident Data to Identify Risk Patterns and Accident Hotspots

🧠 Overview

As part of my Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology, I undertook this project to analyze large-scale traffic accident data. The primary goal was to uncover critical insights into the conditions that contribute to road accidents, with a focus on supporting data-driven decision-making for urban planning and road safety improvements.

🔍 Objective

To analyze U.S. traffic accident data and identify patterns based on:

Road conditions (e.g., Dry, Wet, Icy)

Weather conditions (e.g., Clear, Rain, Fog, Storm)

Time of day (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, Night)

The analysis includes visualizing accident hotspots and exploring key contributing risk factors.

📊 Key Contributions

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed a large, real-world dataset with millions of accident records.

✅ Analyzed the distribution of accidents across varying road surface conditions.

✅ Explored the influence of different weather conditions on accident frequency.

✅ Investigated accident trends across different times of the day.

✅ Created visualizations (heatmaps, bar charts, line graphs) to communicate patterns and hotspots effectively.

✅ Delivered actionable insights to improve road safety and support smarter city infrastructure planning.

📁 Dataset

Name: US_Accidents_March23.csv

Source: US Accident Data

Size: ~7.5 million accident records (2016–2023)

Features: Timestamp, location, weather, road conditions, severity, visibility, and more.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook

Geopandas / Folium for mapping hotspots

Scikit-learn (for any optional clustering or modeling)

📌 Key Insights

🚗 Wet and Icy roads significantly increase accident frequency.

🌧️ Rain and fog are major weather-related contributors to collisions.

🌙 Higher accident rates observed during late-night and early-morning hours.

📍 Urban intersections and highways are notable accident hotspots.
